# YULU_project
yulu is bicycle riding rental service company,in this project I have done data exploration using python used libraries like pandas ,numpy , matplotlib and seaborn I have tried to predict the trends and demand for the bicyles using timeseries data.used hypothesis testing to confirm the statistical validity if variables.

**OUTCOME OF THE PROJECT**

As from 2 Sample T-test we have seen that holiday has no impact on the number of riders at 95% confidence level, Yulu should run similar promotional-campaigns/offers irrespective of whether it is a holiday or not.

As from 2 Sample T-test we have seen that working day has no impact on the number of riders at 95% confidence level, Yulu should run similar promotional-campaigns/offers irrespective of whether it is holiday or not.

As we have seen from Analysis of Variance(ANOVA), that mean number of riders is statistically different at 95% confidence level for different seasons, Yulu should have different strategies for different seasons. Yulu should try to increase the riders in the months of fall and winter when the number of riders goes down considerably and maximize capacity utilization of e-bikes in the months of summer and fall.

As we have seen from Analysis of Variance(ANOVA), that mean number of riders is statistically different at 95% confidence level for different weathers, Yulu should have different strategies for different weathers. Yulu should try to maximize the capacity utilization of e-bikes when the weather is clear or partly clear.

Yulu should perform demand forecasting as we have seen that there is trend and seasonality in the data. Better demand forecasting will lead to better capacity utilization of e-bikes in different seasons
